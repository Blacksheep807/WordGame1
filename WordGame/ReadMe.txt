So, I have started my text-adventure game. So far, I have one room done with a switch
statement and a simple save file that doesn't do much. 
I need to:
1. correct the Inventory system
2. try to implement a dictionary
3. save inventory and rooms to the save file, try to use the XML file
4. add enums to do directions/commands
